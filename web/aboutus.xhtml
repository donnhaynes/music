                    <p style="color:#4682B4">This audio platform was created as a part of final year project, at Queen Mary, University of London. The objective of the platform was to integrate a new feature of the ‘tempo search’ into a eye pleasing and enjoyable interface. This would help users when they knew what types of songs they would want but not the specific song itself.</p>
                    <p style="color:#4682B4">As the exciting new audio platform, TempoSearch lets people discover and enjoy a wide variety of music through a method of retrieval never done before. This platform aims to become known for its unique features, such as the interactive tempo search. Try it out!</p>
